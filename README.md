## Installation

### Preparation: Homebrew

First install Homebrew and its packages with running in dotfiles repo:
```
brew
```
this will install all recommended cli utils and casks (unless excluded).

To exclude GUI programs (casks), find and remove/comment the following line in [brew.sh](brew.sh) file:
```diff
- install_casks
```

### Install dotfiles

To setup actual dotfiles, execute bootstrap script with zsh (preinstalled by brew):
```
zsh bootstrap
```
`--force` or `-f` option can be added to avoid the confirmation prompt.

After successful completion all the files are copied to your $HOME folder.

To update changed dotfiles rerun bootstrap command to apply the changes.

**Caveat**: deletions are not automatically synced with $HOME. Unwanted files should be deleted from both locations individually.
