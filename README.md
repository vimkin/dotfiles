## TODO
- [ ] Try [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- [ ] Consider switch to [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)

## What's in the box?
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Zinit](https://zdharma.github.io/zinit/wiki/)
- [p10k zsh theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- Homebrew: install formulas and casks
- tmux
- Vim

## Installation

First install Homebrew and its packages with running in dotfiles repo:
```
brew
```
this will install all recommended cli utils and casks (unless excluded).

To exclude GUI programs (casks), find and remove/comment the following line in [brew.sh](brew.sh) file:
```diff
- install_casks
```

To setup actual dotfiles, execute bootstrap script with zsh (already installed by brew):
```
zsh bootstrap
```
`--force` or `-f` option can be added to avoid confirmation prompt.

After successful completion all the files are copied to the $HOME folder.

To update changed dotfiles rerun bootstrap command to apply the changes.

**Caveat**: deletions are not automatically synced with $HOME. Unwanted files should be deleted from both locations individually.
